# Do MLB Players Perform Better In Their Contract Year?

In this project, I test whether MLB players perform better in their contract year. Here's a list of folders and files:

* data_prep.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that contains discussion and code concerning data preparation
* analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with data analysis discussion and code
* function.py: Python file with various constants and functions used in data\_prep.ipynb and analysis.ipynb
* data: Holds all the csv's used in data\_prep.ipynb and analysis.ipynb. Subdirectories are discussed in data\_prep.ipynb
